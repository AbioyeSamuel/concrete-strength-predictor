# predictive-ml-algorithms
This repo consists of ml algorithms that can train a model accurately to predict the real time concrete strength.

# Step-by-step procedure on how to set up the project on your devices
1. Download and install an IDE preferably Visual Studio Code (VS Code) from https://code.visualstudio.com/.
--> Open VS Code after installation.
2. Download and install Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/.
--> During installation, make sure to check the option that adds Python to your system PATH.
3. Clone and Set Up the Project for collaboration. In your IDE terminal, 
   git clone https://github.com/AbioyeSamuel/concrete-strength-predictor.git
4. Navigate to the cloned project folder (ML-algorithms) and Create a virtual environment: python -m venv venv
5. Activate the virtual environment and Install the libraries:
--> Mac: source venv/bin/activate
--> Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate
6. Navigate to the Scripts file and run 'python gbr_algorithm.py' to run the GBR model.
8. Yayy! Happy collaboration.
